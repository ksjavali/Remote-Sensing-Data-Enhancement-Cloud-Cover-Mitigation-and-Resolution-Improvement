# Remote-Sensing-Data-Enhancement-Cloud-Cover-Mitigation-and-Resolution-Improvement

## Description
This project focuses on enhancing the quality of remote sensing data by addressing two significant challenges: cloud cover mitigation and resolution improvement. We aim to develop models that effectively reduce cloud cover interference and enhance image resolution, improving the usability of satellite data for various applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and resource management.

The datasets used in this project are available here:
1. [Sen2_MTC_Old](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BSETKZ)

## Load the dataset
For inferencing or training by choosing the images_input to be the cloudy images for training, test_images_output is the cloudy images for testing. The images_output is the clear images for training and test_images_output is the clear images for testing.
